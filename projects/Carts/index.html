        <h2>Shopping Carts</h2>
        <p>
          &emsp; The data of Shopping Carts is stored on
          <span>LocalStorage</span>. This is first time to make shopping carts.
          It's kind of different with TodoList. From Product page to Carts page,
          It needs to render two page. The <span>Products</span> is render by
          objects, and <span>Carts</span> is render by LocalStorage. The big
          problem I face, which is adding the same type of product to
          localStorage. I think it's first time, so I'm not familiar. I think
          next time I make shopping carts must be better, because I have done
          this once by myself. <br /><br />
