        &emsp; It’s so glad that I finish the first static website finally. The
        total time costs me for 2 weeks from organizing the concepts and
        functions to finishing the project. The process is not easy, but I learn
        a lot from this static website. For instance, I know more about how to
        operate the function of array and how create the TodoList and Shopping
        Carts with LocalStorage. I think LocalStorage is similar with DataBase.
        It also needs the methods of CRUD as API.
        <br /><br />
        &emsp; After this experience, I still have a large step that need to
        work hard. Some basic concept of JavaScript such as Promise and Async
        Await is I’m desired to understand and operate it. When I learn a lot, I
        feel more interesting. Today always better than yesterday.
