        &emsp; In article, I want to share about my paths and my thoughts, why I
        chose this path as my final path.<br /><br />
        &emsp; I want to share my education first.<br />
        <span>&emsp; (HIGh SCHOOL)</span><br />
        &emsp; In high school. I studied in Food and Beverage department. I
        thought if I had a skill, it would help me get the job easier. It’s
        true. When I was looking for a part-time, the restaurant they hired me
        because I had some related and fundamental knowledge on food. Therefore,
        they offered me the job, which let me earn my allowance. So, I used to
        be a waiter, assistant of chef, or bartender. As you know, I have worked
        in food industry for over 2 years, which let me learn lots of
        experience. (What I learn from my previous jobs, I write down on another
        post.) Then, I started to wonder that did I choose chef as my career
        job. I was 19. I was young. I haven’t finished to travel and explore
        this world. I still desired to learn a lot, to touch something that I
        haven’t seen, so I left the restaurant.<br /><br />
        <span>&emsp; (FJCU University)</span><br />
        &emsp; In college, I chose the English department as my major. I
        considered that English is a global language. If I learn it well, it
        will help me a lot, on business and future. The beginning of period,
        it’s hard, because my basics is not well, and Professor is lecturing
        with English without Chinese. I realize if I don’t spend more time to
        chase them, I will be left behind. The distance will be longer. When I
        have progress, they also have progress, so the distance is not easy to
        be shorter. I have to chase and spend more and more time for filling the
        gap. <br /><br />
        <span>&emsp; (Junior in FJCU University)</span><br />
        &emsp; When I'm a junior in college, I start to think that what do I
        want to do in the future? I pretty understand I don’t want to be an
        English teacher, or a translator. I think it’s not suitable for me. If I
        do, I will live with unhappiness. So, I start to explore and try
        everything that I’m curious. Accidently, I touch the programming
        language. I found this is so interesting, so I start to learn such as
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, start with Front-End language. This also let me
        understand the programmer is a job I want to work with for my life. I
        start to search every resource on google for training my programming
        skills from freecodeCamp to udemy. I understand I'm not major in CS
        related, so I purchase some lecture such as Data Structure and Algorithm
        for increasing my knowledge on CS.
        <br /><br />
        <span>&emsp; (End of Article)</span><br />
        &emsp; At the end, I want to say, even the path is not straight, but if
        the destination is same, it's ok with walk a little longer, those paths
        bring me precious and meaningful memories.
