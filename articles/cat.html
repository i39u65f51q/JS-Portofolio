        &emsp; I have a cat. Her name is “Moon”. One day, my friend he called
        me, he saw a kitten was trapped in a tire, and asks me to help. She was
        meowing loudly for a while. We didn’t see her parents around, so I take
        her to home. I remember the first time I saw her. She was very small.
        Her age was between a month and two months. Then, she became my
        responsibility. I became her father. <br /><br />
        <span>&emsp; (Feeling as the parents QQ)</span><br />
        &emsp; Few days past, I started to realize that raising a kid would
        drive me crazy, and I also understand how exhausting was when my parents
        were raising me. I spent my whole day to take care my cat. For instance,
        I had to play with her, feed her, and watch her. Especially, she was
        meowing loudly. My ears hurt. Days by days, I found I can understand the
        cat’s language. The sounds of meowing had different rhythms, which was
        very helpful for me. I can know she was hungry or angry, or maybe I was
        crazy. Another problem let me have headache, which was picky eater. If
        the feed smell like not yummy, she would not eat all the day. Therefore,
        I spent long time on looking for a feed that she like. <br /><br />
        <span>&emsp; (Growing Up)</span><br />
        &emsp; After a year, she’s gradually growing up. She’s not often on
        meowing, and more mature than before as an adult. Nowadays, I think she
        is a happy cat and living with comfortable life. She doesn’t have to
        wander on street
