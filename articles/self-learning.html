        &emsp;It's a tough road I walk on. Everything I learn have to by
        myself.<br /><br />
        &emsp; The only method of self-learning is searching every resource that
        I can find to solve my problems. Sometimes, the problem it's not easy as
        I think. It's also related to the fundamental knowledge, so I spent more
        time to solve these problems, such as Programming which I have to spent
        time to learn <span> "Cyber Security"</span>,
        <span> "Data Structure"</span> and <span>"Algorithm"</span>, and more
        for let me become a better programmer. Therefore, for solving all
        problem that I have to step by step, calm down, and grow up. I'm glad
        I'm born with high technology. Let me have chance for using google to
        solve my problems. Sometime, Google will response me the numerous
        different answers and logics, because a problem has thousands answers
        that can solve it. As what we heard ”All roads lead to Rome”, there's
        not only a solution. Therefore, we have to read every answer and analyze
        it to find the better and newest one. Then, another problem come out, if
        I turn off google, can I still solve the problem after I search the
        google? Probably I can, or not. So, I think training is important, times
        by times. When I decide to become a programmer, this road can't turn
        back. I have to step forward to finish the goals that I set, and become
        stronger and more powerful than yesterday.
