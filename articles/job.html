        first. You will know more about my background. <br /><br />Let’s GO!<br /><br />
        <span>&emsp;(2016/8-2018/10 in Food Industry)</span><br />
        &emsp; My first job was an intern in “Mitsui Food”. The reason how I get
        in this company, because my high school had cooperated with this
        company. Therefore, when I was senior in high school, I started to work
        at this restaurant until I graduated. In restaurant, I was responsible
        for table service and preparing the food. Most customers are very rich,
        because the price of food was not cheap. The cheaper one which cost me
        about five hundreds. So, managers they care about our attitude and
        service. I thought what I learned from this job was soft power. It
        trained me that how to communicate with customer, and handle the
        emergency. After a year, I considered about my career, so I decided to
        left from this company to get in the college. <br /><br />
        <span>&emsp;(2019/9-2020/8 in Drinks Shop)</span><br />
        &emsp; In college, I still work my way through college. The first job I
        get which is a drinks shop, I’m responsible for making the drinks, and
        checking. The job isn’t hard, but it’s very busy. Therefore, the
        teamwork and communication are important. Everyone has their work. We
        have to finish our work first, then support other. In time, we trust
        everyone’s ability. Because of trusts that we can work fluidly. <br />
        <br />
        <span>&emsp;(2020/8-2022/5 in Career Development FJU)</span><br />
        &emsp; The next job I get which is a part-time job, work in FJCU
        university. The department is part of Academic Affairs Office. I’m
        responsible for assisting in organizing the activities and lectures to
        make sure every detail greatly. I’m also using Office tools for
        finishing my job, which is classifying the files. I learn a lot from
        this job. In activity, I can get some ideas or concepts from HR. They
        share their experience or story with us. Therefore, I can find my lacks
        of ability, and improve it.<br />As you read, I have done many jobs. Do
        I regret my experience? I think the answer is no. I am who I am because
        of these experiences.
