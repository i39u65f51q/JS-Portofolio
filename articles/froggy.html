        &emsp; He is one of famous Youtuber I think, but he must be my favorite
        one. <br /><br />
        &emsp; He has a channel, which is NSFW(Not Save For Work). I like his
        personality and attitude on living in this world. He said
        <span>
          “if there’s something you are interested, just do it. The price of
          restarting is not terrible as you think”.</span
        >
        It sounds very irresponsible. But I think life has once and we can’t let
        time to be returned, how about to be brave choose a life what we want to
        live. This is how I admire him. Froggy Chiu used to be a supervisor of
        marketing with a high salary, but now he’s selling the house for
        creating the channel as a job. He sacrifices the high-pay for getting a
        life that he like to live, which is very brave. This also inspires me. I
        don’t have to be afraid too much. I’m still young. I can challenge
        anything that I never try.
